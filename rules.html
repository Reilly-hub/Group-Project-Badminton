            <h4>Court</h4>
            <img src="images/court.png" alt="pic of court" width="350"/>
            <p class="normal">
                The standard badminton court is a rectangle that is 13.4 meters long and 6.1 meters wide. The height of the ceiling above the court should be at least 6.1 meters. The net posts must be fixed into the ground and suspend the edges of the net 1.55 meters off the ground. The net hangs slightly lower in the middle, but the rules specify that the center of the net must reach 1.524 meters high.

                <br><br>The field line is 40 mm wide and must be drawn with white or yellow paint, and a minimum space of 1 and 2 meters should be reserved for the sideline and bottom line of the court respectively.
                
                <br><br>The badminton net is made of dark fibers with a mesh size of 15-20 mm. The net is 6.10 meters long and 0.76 meters tall.
                
                <br><br>Sideline: In singles, the sideline is the inner sideline of the court.
                In doubles, the sideline is the outside sideline of the court.
                
                <br><br>Bottom line: The bottom line for singles and doubles matches is the outermost bottom line.
            </p>
            <h4>Serving</h4>
            <img src="images/bounds.png" alt="pic of bounds" width="200" height="400"/>
            <p class="normal">
                When a player serves, both players must stand in their respective sections of the serving area with their feet on the ground without treading upon the boundary line of the serving court. 

                <br><br>The racket must hit the birdie bottom first and the birdie must be hit from a position lower than 115 cm. During the entire serve, the racket head should point downward. Overhead serves are prohibited.

                <br><br>In singles, when the server's score is even, players should stand in the right serving area and prepare to serve or receive. When the server's score is odd, players should stand in the left serving area and prepare to serve or receive.

                <br><br>In doubles, when the server's score is even, players standing in the right serving area should prepare to serve or receive. When the server's score is odd, players standing in the left serving area should prepare to serve or receive. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.
            </p>
            <h4>Scoring</h4>
            <p class="normal">
                After the serve, the game officially begins. Players from both sides alternately hit the birdie until one side fouls or the birdie falls into one side's court. 

                <br><br>In the 21-point system, players score a point regardless of whether they serve. When a player scores, the player also gets the right to serve. When a player scores consecutively, the player alternately serves in his two serving areas. When two players reach a tie of 20 points in the game, whoever gains a two-point lead wins the game, except when there is a tie at 29â€“29. The score is not extended indefinitely and the winner is the first to score 30.

                <br><br>In the old 15-point system, only the server can score. In singles, if the server fails to score, the opponent will obtain the right to serve. In doubles, both players of one side have the right to serve. If the first server fails to score, the second server will continue to serve; if the second server fails to score, the opponents will have the right to serve. When players are tied for 13 or 14, the player that reached 13 or 14 points first, chooses if the game will go for 3 or 5 more points to win. In women's singles, when there is a tie of 9 or 10 points, the player reaching 9 or 10 points chooses if the game will go for 2 or 3 more points to win.
